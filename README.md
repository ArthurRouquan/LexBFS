# Lexicographic Breadth-First Search Algorithm

Implementation in C++20 of the [Lex-BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_breadth-first_search) algorithm based on the idea of partition refinement (first developed by Donald J. Rose, Robert E. Tarjan, and George S. Lueker), in linear time O(|V| + |E|) given a graph G = (V, E) and an optional starting vertex. This implementation was made for educational purposes.

## How to run it?

This project uses CMake. To run the executable you need to pass a graph instance .col file:

```
$ lexbfs ../graph_instances/toy2.col

Input instance G = (V, E) - |V| = 7, |E| = 14
Lex-BFS ordering: 0 1 2 3 6 4 5 
Lex-BFS algorithm's duration: 4 us
The graph is chordal.
```
