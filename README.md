# Lexicographic Breadth-First Search Algorithm in modern C++

Implementation in modern C++ of the [Lex-BFS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexicographic_breadth-first_search) algorithm based on the idea of partition refinement (first developed by Donald J. Rose, Robert E. Tarjan, and George S. Lueker), in linear time O(|V| + |E|) given a graph G = (V, E) and an optional starting vertex.

## How to run it?

```console
make
./bin/main instance_name
```
