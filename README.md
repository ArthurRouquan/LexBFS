# Lexicographic Breadth-First Search Algorithm

Implementation in modern C++ of the Lex-BFS algorithm based on the idea of partition refinement (first developed by Donald J. Rose, Robert E. Tarjan, and George S. Lueker (1976)), in linear time in O(|V| + |E|) given a graph G = (V, E) and an optional starting vertex.
